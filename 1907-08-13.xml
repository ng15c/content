                        cleanses the pores of the skin as nothing else can
                        do, makes it pearly white, gives life to the tissues, 
                        elasticity to the muscles, and a deliciously cool 
                        feeling to the skin.
                            Its unique properties are due to Icilma Natural

                        <head>morocco's trouble.</head>
                        <p> Events in Morocco are moving much more
                        swiftly than was anticipated. For, even before
                        the small French expeditionary force, now on
                        its way from Oran to Casa Blanca, has had
                        time to pass from the Mediterranean into the 
                        Atlantic, the French warships already on the
                        spot have bombarded the Moorish port. The
                        bombardment was not an affair of blank
                        cartridge. It was carried through in serious
                        earnest, and the Moors are said to have 
                        lost heavily in killed and wounded. The 
                        engagement, if such a term can be applied to
                        it, was precipitated by the Moors themselves,
                        and, according to one version, was due to the 
                        treachery which is engrained in their national
                        character. The French Consulate had asked 
                        the commander of the Galilee for a guard of
                        marines, and it was arranged with the Bashaw
                        of Casa Blanca that the guard should be landed.
                        But the marines had no sooner set foot on shore
                        than they were fired upon by the Bashaw's own
                        Moorish troops and by the tribesmen who had
                        come into the town to make common cause
                        with them. An officer and six sailors were 
                        wounded, but the rest drove the Moors before
                        them at the point of the bayonet and made
                        their way to the Consulate. Then the bombard-
                        ment began, and the two French crusiers,
                        "DuChayla" and "Galilee", poured shells into the 
                        town batteries till they were reduced to ruins, 
                        and destroyed the surrounding quarter belong-
                        ing to the hostile tribesmen. The Moors, of
                        course, were quite unable to make any effective
                        reply, and their commander speedily requested
                        a cessation of the bombardment and the pardon
                        of the French admiral, who peremtorily told
                        him to surrender to the French Consul. Only 
                        sheer perversity, says the "Daily Telegraph"
                        can suggest any sympathy for the ruffianly 
                        Moors who have brought this well-deserved
                        punishment upon their own heads, and the
                        twelve Europeans who were butchered and
                        barbarously mutilated the other day have thus,
                        in a sense, been promptly avenged. But the</p>

                        <p>bombardment does not close the chapter. 
                        Rather, it begins a new one, of which the
                        sequel is beyond all guessing. "Only God 
                        knoweth" is a favourite Moorish proverb, and
                        it is peculiarly applicable to the present
                        case. But Monday's events have cleared the 
                        way for the arrival of General Drude and the 
                        little army of three thousand and have given 
                        the Moors a foretaste of what they may ex-
                        pect if they indulge in further acts of hostility.
                        It is important to note that the Spanish gun
                        boat landed a party of firty marines for the
                        protection of the Spanish Consulate, while a 
                        force of five hundred Spanish troops is under
                        orders to-operate with General Drude. No one 
                        can over-estimate the value at this juncture of
                        a thoroughly good understanding between the 
                        French and Spanish Governments, who were
                        designated by the Convention of Algeciras to 
                        act as the mandatories of Europe, insomuch as
                        they were authorised to organise a police force
                        for Morocco. For the tranquility of the diplo-
                        matic world it is essential that this co-opera-
                        tion shall continue, and the Spanish Govern-
                        ment, while naturally anxious not to become
                        involved in Morocco more deeply than the
                        honour of Spain requires, is to be congratulated
                        on ignoring the outcry raised against its
                        intervention by a strong section of the Opposi-
                        tion, which has throughout disliked the role
                        assigned to and accepted by Spain.</p>
                        <p> Unquestionably, the situation is serious
                        though the steps taken by France are re-
                        proachable, and her intentions have been 
                        announced to and have received the approval
                        of all the Great Powers. Such is the perfect
                        confidence reposed in the Government of the
                        Republic by Great Britain that is now declared
                        that no British warship will be sent to Casa 
                        Blanca, inasmuch as the measures to be taken 
                        by the French are considered entirely adequate
                        for the protection of British interests. We
                        hope that other Powers will show a like con-
                        fidence, if only to help to convince the Moors
                        that they cannot expect to derive any advant-
                        age from international jealousies. Unfor-
                        tunately, the Sultan of Morocco, with whom 
                        France and Spain will have to deal, exercises
                        but a very shadowy and slender authority over
                        his own officials, such as the Bashaw of Casa
                        Blanca, and still less over the Kabyle tribes
                        aneu, who are practically responsible for the
                        recent outrages. The Maghzen have hastened
                        to express to the French Minister at Few their
                        "profound regret" for the outbreak, just as
                        they regretted the murder of Dr. Mauchamps
                        near the Algerian border at Marrakesh. Both 
                        regrets are useless when they are not backed by
                        any prood of their sincerity. No once behaves
                        in the desire of the Maghzen to put a stop 
                        to fanatical murders, and if they had the 
                        desire it is more than doubtful if they have
                        the power. For these abominable outrages
                        are ebullitions of strong national feeling 
                        against the introduction of an unwelcome
                        civilisation, and against the appearance of
                        the Cross in the hand of the Crescent. The 
                        most powerful factor in Morocco is not the 
                        Sultan, not the Pretender, nor Raisuli, but
                        Ma El Ainin, the holy man of the desert at
                        the back of Capy Juby. He is the Maharaj of
                        the land, and a "holy war: in Morocco is not
                        a contingency that any Power could face with
                        equanimity. Bombardments always have 
                        sequels. No Englishman--and no Frenchman 
                        for that matter--will forget what a surprising 
                        chain of events has followed the shelling
                        of Alexandria. When a European nation has
                        landed an expeditionary force in a town after
                        a bombardment which has shattered the 
                        half-savage authority, it finds it no easy matter
                        to withdraw, for it cannot face the respectibi-
                        lity of leaving anarchy rampant. With a strong 
                        central Moorish Government, on which de-
                        pendence could be placed, the positions of
                        affairs would be much simpler. Satisfaction
                        could be demanded, and when it had been 
                        given the avenging force could retire. In this 
                        case withdrawal will be hazardous, inasmuch
                        as other outrages are almost certain to follow
                        --they are already threatened at Rabat and 
                        elsewhere--whether there is holy war or not.
                        France and Spain will, of course, act with
                        resolution, and will not shrink because the 
                        future is uncertain and the commitment may 
                        be heavy. But those who know the story of the 
                        conquest and occupation of Algeria will not
                        uner-estimate the risks and strain of a gue-
                        rilla war in a difficult and practically unknown
                        country, and against wild races of the martial 
                        quality of the Moors. They will appreciate,
                        moreover, the anxieties which would weigh
                        upon Ministers at Paris and Madrid, even if--
                        which is, perhaps, rather too much to hope--
                        none but friendly and sympathetic eyes were
                        watching the fulfilment of the task. </p>

                <p>(Anjourd huy d 11h. 12 a.m.)</p>
                <p> Le vent a tourne. Des l'ouverture de la
                corbeille kes vendeurs, hier encour introu-
                vables, etaient a la recherche des acheteaurs
                qui avaient a leur tour disparu. Il parait qu'il
                a'agit de realisations de progit. Ce sont donc
                les memes qui ont-schete ces jours derniers a 
                des prix avantageux qui veulent aujourd'hui
                vendre pour realiser les benefices acquis. Dans
                ce cas, l'explication a la volte-face de ce matin
                est toute trouvee. Les acheteurs de naguere se
                sont tout simplement transformes en vendeurs:
                maid le revirement a ete trop rapide et trop una-
                nime a la fois pour permettre aux interesses de
                faire leur operationl.C'edt pourquoinotre marche
                a debutefaible et en baisse et vette allure
                s'est maintenue jusqu'a la fin de la seance.
                I; y a eu quelques transactions clairsemees
                en Agricole, National. Bank et quelques
                autres valeurs, maid les operations n'ont
                eu d'importance qu'en Estates et en United.</p>
                <p> Les valeurs dirigeantes sont toutes en
                reaction : l'Agricole flechit de 8 3/16 ache-
                teurs a 8 3/18 vendeurs, la National Bank 
                de 20 5/8 a 20 1/2, la Delta Light de 9 13/16
                a 9 3/4, la Daira de 13 a 12 15/16 et 
                l'Obligation Credit Foncier de 304 l'ancien-
                ne et 260 la nouvelle a 303 1/2 et 259
                respectivement.</p>
                <p> En baisse egalement les Dividendes Tram-
                ways de 300 a 297, la Behera de 20 5/8 a
                20 1/2, les Lots Turcs de 165 a 164, l'ac-
                tion Khedivial Mail de 4 a 3 7/8, la
                Land Bank de 7 1/4 a 7      le Com-
                ptoir de 3 1/8 a 3.</p>

                gresse de 4 11/16 a 5, les Eaux du Caire 
                de 114 les actions de capital et 190 les actions
                de jouissance aux cours respectifs de 114 et
                192, les. Biere du Caire de 87 a 89 les
                Privilegiees et de 35 a 38 les Dividendes, la
                Building Lands de 2 3/8 a 2 1/2, le Credit
                Franco-Egyptien de 4 3/16 a 4 1/4 et l'ac-
                tion Allotment de 2 1/2 a 2 13/16.</p>
                <p> Parmi les petites valeurs, la Salt and Soda
                revient de 19 a 18/6, la Delta Land de 2 1/8
                a 2 1/16, les Sucreries de 30 a 25, l'Ordinary 
                Khedivial Mail de 21/6 a 21/3, les Estates de
                7/8 a 3/4 scheteurs, la Levico de 7/16 a 15/32,
                tandia que les fondateurs Allotment et United 
                s'avancent, la premiere de 75 a 80 P.T. et la 
                seconde de 2 1/2 a 2 9/16.</p>
                <p> Sur le reste de la cote il n'y a pas de chan-
                gements a signaler.</p>
                <p> Les marches europeans temoignent en gene-
                ral d'une reaction repondant a la hausse du
                taux d'escompte et a la baisse du Consolide
                Anglais et de la Rente Francaise. Il n'y a que
                les valeurs egyptiennes qui dont preuve d'un
                soutien aussi exceptionnel que l'avait ete leur 
                recente depression. Il s'agit probablement du
                retablissement d'un equilibre qui avait ete
                rompu par l'exageration de la baisse des valeurs
                egyptiennes.</p>

                <p>           Le Caire, Lundi 12 Aout</p>
                <p> Le taux de l'escompte libre est reste, samedi
                dernier a Londres, a 4 pour cent.</p>
                <p> Au Stock Exchange, le Consolide anglais a
                perdu pour les deux derniers jours de la se-
                maine 3/4 de livre a 81 1/8. L'Unifiee est restee
                inchangee a 101 1/2. La National Bank a 
                gagne 1/4 a 20 1/4. L'Agricole s'est maintenue 
                ferme a 8 1/8, ainsi que la Daira a 12 3/4 et la 
                Delta Light a 10.</p>
                <p> A Paris, le Credit Foncier Egyptien a reac-
                tionne de 1 franc a 687. La Banque d'Athenes
                a ete soutenue a 112 et les Lots Turcs ont fait 
                167 sans changement.</p>
                <p> Bien que la reprise ait commence, il y a deja
                passablement de temps, le marche ne montre
                pas encoure d'essoudlement : bien au contraire, 
                la hausse s'est affirmee plus franche durant la 
                seance de ce jour, passant d'une valeur a une
                autre. Il est actuellement tangible que les
                placements deviennent de jour en jour plus 
                nombreux, et si l'on ajoute que les vendeurs
                se terrent avec l'esperance de beneficier plus 
                largement en ayant un peu de patience, il ap-
                parait comme tres comprehensible que la cote
                ait present aujourd'hui en cloture une hausse
                generale. Il y a di reste peu a crainde, car
                les transactions se faissant au comptant et
                toutes les valeurs etant encore a des prix tres 
                bas, une reaction, toujours possible, ne pourrait
                pas etre bien serieuse.</p>
                <p> Quoiqu'il en soit, la seanse a ete excellente, 
                et elle aurait ete beaucoup plus animee si les
                vendeurs n'avaient pas ete introuvables pour
                de nombreux titres.</p>
                <p> Dans le compartiment des Banques, la Na-
                tional Bank hausse a 20 5/8-11-16 en avance 
                de 3/8 sur son dernier cours. L'Agricole fait
                de meme a 8 1/8-3/16. La Cassa di Sconto 
                remonte a 42 et la Banque d'Athenes a 114.</p>

                ciennes du Credit Foncier se relevent a 305 et
                les nouvelles a 260-261. L'Allotment a avance 
                a 2 9/16 et sa part a P.T. 70. Les Entreprises 
                Immobilieres et Travaux, des plus actives,
                bondissent a 2 5/8 et leur part a P.T. 44. Les
                Heliopolis sont recherchees a 247.</p>
                <p> Dans les Industrielles, la Brasserie de Pyra-
                mides remonte a 90 et sa fondateur a 39. La 
                Salt and Soda est en reprise a 18.</p>

                    <p> "La semaine ecoulee a presente, malgre une
                        activite peu intense au debut, une amelioration
                        considerable sur la precedente. Cette meilleure
                        tenue du marche provient en grande partie des 
                        cours soutenus que Londres nous envoie egu-
                        liarement depui quelqu temps.</p>
                    <p> "Cette persistance de nos valeurs daos leur 
                        fermete a Londres a fini par influencer les
                        esprits, et, comme une eclairvie se produit in
                        dubitablement sur notre place, les haussiers 
                        n'ont pas eu de peine a faire remonter de plu-
                        sieurs fractions l'ensemble de la cote. Le ven
                        deurs deviennent, du reste, beucoup plus cir
                        conspects. Voyant le vent souffler a la hausse,
                        ils s'abstiennent avec l'espoir de liquider a des
                        cours muilleurs, et ils n'ont pas tort.</p>

                        bles, il en adviendra un agjuvant enorme pour
                        le pays et meme la disparition d'une crise 
                        que l'on avait un peu entretenue comme un

                        de decider le retablissement, les avis sont
                        partages, mais l'immense majorite s'y montre
                        favorable, motivant son appreciation sur le
                        fait que sans marche a terme une Bourse n'a
                        que peu de raison d'etre, les transactions au
                        comptant pouvant se faire partout sans grand
                        inconvenient."</p>
                    <p> D'un etat comparatif des recettes des
                        Egyptian Markets, il resulte que les benefices
                        pour l'exercise 1906-1907 s'elevent actuelle-
                        ment a 25,890 contre 21,800 pour la
                        meme periode de l'exercice precedent. </p>
                    <p> Les recettes en 1904 s'eleverent a 26, 602,
                        en 1905 a 26, 537 et en 1906 a 36, 773.</p>
                    <p>La diminuation en 1905 s'explique par suite 
                        de la fermeture des marches vu l'epidemie de

                        <p> General satisfaction is expressed throughout
                        the country at the distinguished gallantry of
                        the troops and marines at Casablanca and the 
                        effective continuous shell-fire which has re-
                        stored confidence in the guns, but there is 
                        some anxiety as to the duration and extent 
                        of the warfare.</p>
                        <p>     The events in Casablanca have stirred up
                            the tribesmen in all directions, endangering
                            the position of Europeans on the coast and 
                            inland.</p>
                        <p> The Government does not intend to send 
                        reinforcements to Morocco, the troops under
                        General Drude being considered sufficient. The
                        movements of transports from Toulon to Oran
                        is merely precautionary.<meaure type="IndexNo">(Reuter)</meaure></p>

                        <p> The population is preventing Europeans
                        from embarking because their presence shelters
                        the town from bombardment.

                        <p>     Some fresh attacks were made at Casablanca
                            on Saturday night, during the course of 
                            which one of the French soldiers was killed 
                            and ten wounded. The Moors were repulsed
                            with great losses. The number of troops are 
                            considered sufficient and a police force is
                            being organised among them.
                                Every precaution is taken to guard against 
                            eventualities. Spain is sending reinforcements.
                            The neighbouring tribes of Magazan are de-
                            manding money and the treatening to attack
                            in case of refusal. Admiral Aube is ready to 
                            land troops and bombard.<measure type="index">(Havas)</measure></p>

                            <p>     Discussing Pan-Islamism, with which the 
                                Egyptian national movement is deeply tinged, 
                                Lord Cromer tells us that Pan-Islamism is 
                                generally held to mean a combination of all
                                the Muslums throughout the world to defy 
                                and to resist the Christian powers. It is, more-
                                over, a convenient phrase for conveying a num-
                                ber of other ideas, more or less connected with 
                                its primary signification. In the first place it
                                means, in Egypt, more or less subserviency to 
                                the Sultan ; but the later version of the 
                                programme of the leasers of the national move-
                                ment is that they have no wish to draw closer 
                                the bonds between Turkey and Egypt, and
                                their only desire is to maintain the suzerainty
                                of the Sultan. In the second place Pan-Islamism 
                                almost necessarily denotes a recrudescence of
                                racial and religious animosity ; and in the third
                                place an attempt to regenerate Islam on
                                Islamic lines ; in other words, to revivify and
                                stereotype in the twentieth century the prin-
                                ciples laid down more than a thousand years 
                                ago for the guidance of a primative society.
                                    On the other hand, there are, as Lord 
                                Cromer points out, a small but increasing
                                number of Egyptians, of whom comparatively
                                little is heard, but who deserve the title of 
                                Nationalist quite as much as their competitors
                                of a different school of though and action, 
                                men who hold opinions very analogous to those
                                advocated by the late Seyyid Ahmed, who
                                founded the Aligarh College in India.
                                    Their fundamental idea [Lord Cromer says]
                                is to reform various Moslem institutions with-
                                out shaking the main pillars on which the
                                faith of Islam rests. They are truly Nationa-
                                list, in the sense of wishing to advance the
                                interests of their countrymen and co-religion-
                                ists, but they are not tainted with Pan-Islam-
                                ism. Their programme involves not opposition
                                to, but co-operation with, Europeans in the
                                introduction of Western civilisation into the 
                                country. The main hope of Egyptian Nationa-
                                lism, in the only true and practicable sense of 
                                the word, lies with those who belong to this
                                party.
                                    Is there any chance of Pan-Islamism--such
                                as Lord Cromer describes, or in any other 
                                shape--being developed in India. According
                                to the last census the total number of Mu-
                                hammadans is 62 1/2 millions or 212 per mile
                                per population of the Indian Empire. No
                                doubt, as Lord Cromer says of Egypt, there
                                are some Moslems who would be willing, 
                                were such a course is possible, to seperate 
                                the political from the religious and even 
                                possibly from the racial issues. But he adds :
                                    If such are their wishes and intentions,
                                I entertain very little doubt that they will
                                find them impossible of execution. Unless
                                they can convince the Moslem masses of 
                                their militant Islamism, they will fail to arrest
                                their attention or to attract their sympa-
                                thy. Appeals, either overt or covert, to social
                                and religious passions, are thus a necessity of
                                their existence in order to ensure the furtherance
                                of their political programme.
                                    This is equally true in India. I need not do
                                more than allude to recent events which show
                                that the idea of a Pan-Islamic movement in 
                                India, embracing the whole country, and bring-
                                ing back what I may term the "Moghal Raj"
                                is inconceivable, at least unless the British 
                                Government retires altogether, and leaves the
                                continent to anarchy and confusion, the final
                                result of which might possibly by the establish-
                                ment of a Muhammadan kingdom.
                                    Referring to the position of the national 
                                movement, independently of any real or im-
                                aginary connection it may have with Pan-
                                Islamism, Lord Cromer explains how more than
                                doubtful is the extent to which the so-called
                                National party represents the real wishes
                                and aspirations of the mass of people. Nothing
                                could be more ungenerous than to withhold 
                                sympathy from the legitimate aspirations of 
                                the educated youth for a greater share in the
                                government of their country ; but nothing 
                                could be more unwise than to abstain from 
                                pointing out the limits which must be 
                                assigned to those aspirations. Further, Lord 
                                Cromer very properly insists that European
                                agency is required in Egypt in the first place
                                to supply the technical knowledge which, until
                                very recently, the Egyptians have had no 
                                opportunity of acquiring ; in the second place
                                to remedy those defects in the Egyptian 
                                character which have been developed by a long 
                                course of misgovernment.</p>

                            <p>     Under the first book of the 
                            sanguine view, but he does not fail to remind 
                            us that the process of substituting indigenous
                            for European agency must be slow. "Any
                            attempt to hurry can only lead to disappoint-
                            ment and eventually in all probability to a 
                            reaction which will be to the detriment of 
                            Egyptian interest. Under the second head
                            he shows that the substitution of Egyptian for
                            European agency must necessarily take even
                            more time in these cases than in those where 
                            the transfer depends on the acquisition of 
                            technical knowledge by the Egyptians. And
                            he adds that amongst the defects which, for
                            purposes of administration, appear most of
                            all to require rectification, are the fear of 
                            assuming individual responsibility the absence
                            of adequate capacity to exercise with
                            firmness, intelligence, and consideration for
                            others, such functions as are usually vest-
                            ed in responsible agents, and the tendency,
                            so common amongst the Egyptians of run-
                            ning to extremes both in thought and
                            action.</p>
                            <p>     Regarding the wider and more strictly 
                            political portion of the National programme
                            what is proposed is, first, the creation of a 
                            Ministry reponsible to the chamber, and depen-
                            dent for its existence on the maintenance
                            of the majority ; and secondly complete con-
                            trol over the finances of the country, such as 
                            that exercised by the elected Chambers in the
                            United Kingdom and in other European 
                            countries. The adoption of the first of these
                            proposals would, in Lord Cromer's opinion,
                            produce a state of things which may, without
                            exaggeration, be termed chaotic. Intrigue of
                            all sorts would be rife. The system of bribery 
                            and corruption, which was at one time so pre-
                            valent in the country, and which is even now
                            only dying a lingering death, would receive a 
                            freach impuse. It is more than probable that
                            under the specious title of free institutions the 
                            wose evils of personal government would
                            reappear. The adoption of the second proposal
                            --that of handing over complete financial con-
                            trol to the Chamber--would almost inevitably
                            lead to National bankruptcy. Is there then no 
                            hope for Egyptian Nationalism? Lord Cromer's
                            counter programme is the creation of a local
                            International Council, which would create a 
                            community of interests among the heteroge-
                            neous population which inhabits the valley of 
                            the Nile, and would thus be the first step 
                            towards the formation of an Egyptian National 
                            spirit in the only sense in which that spirit 
                            can be evoked without detriment to the in-
                            terests of the country.</p>
                            <p>     May one not apply much of this reasoning to 
                            India? When was India ruled by Indians? Cen-
                            turies have passed since the Hindu sovereign-
                            ties were swept away by Muhammadan invaders
                            from the North. I need not repeat the well-
                            known facts which show conclusively that there
                            is no such thing as one Indian nation. It is 
                            only partially true that there are Indian na-
                            tions. Geographical boundaries, as Sir Alfred
                            Lyall says, have no correspondence at all with
                            distinctive institutions or groupings of the
                            people and have comparatively little political 
                            significance. The Parsees - one of the most 
                            intelligent races, now classed as Indians have
                            no country on the Indian continent. So, too,
                            the Muhammadans ; one of their number rules
                            an immense tract of territory mostly populated
                            by Hindus. A Hindu Rajah of Kashmir rules a
                            State mostly peopled by Muhammadans 
                            Maratha chiefs govern States not peopled by 
                            Marathas.</p>
                            <p>     Nor do the leaders of the Nationalist move-
                            ment in India seem to have a very clear idea
                            of what they themselves want. For example,
                            My. Dadabhai Naoroji used to apeak of "the
                            very bright side of British rule": he has also
                            told us how necessary it is "for the important
                            political object pf maintaining British rule, to
                            reserve by law for European alone such places
                            of power of control only as may be necessary 
                            for the purpose"; and he has talked of the
                            absolute necessity of the maintenance of super-
                            vision of British rule, and of the conviction of 
                            the natives that a real regeneration, civilisation 
                            and advancement of India materially, morally,
                            and politically, depends upon the long continu-
                            ance of the British rule. It was not at
                            one time his view that the natives should
                            attain to the highest positions of control and 
                            power ; in fact, he considered that the con-
                            trolling power of Englishmen in India was 
                            wanted as much for the benefit of India as for 
                            the benefit of Englan; he admitted the ne-
                            cessity of maintaining European civil and 
                            military services in India, his contention being
                            that the cost should not be wholly exacted 
                            from India.</p>
                            <p>     Such was the view of Mr. Dadabbai Naoroji
                            only a few years ago, but now, as the professed 
                            leader of the "moderates," not of the "extre-
                            mists," the alteration of the services from
                            Europeans to Indian is the key-note of his
                            programme.</p>
                            <p>     The administration in all services, depet-
                            ments and details (he says), should be in the 
                            hands of the people themselves of India.
                            as in the United Kingdom and the Colonies
                            all taxation and legislation, and the power of
                            spending the taxes are in the hands of the 
                            people of those countries, so should also be 
                            the rights of the people of India. </p>
                            <p>     But do these claims represent the real
                            wishes and aspirations of the mass of the peo-
                            ple? Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji and his friends
                            may collect "a body of able men and good
                            speakers to go into all nooks and corners of
                            India and inform the people in their own lan-
                            guages of their British rights and how to exercise
                            and enjoy them"; but will these men be the true 
                            friends of the millions of toiling peasants 
                            and labourers, of petty artisans and traders?
                            That is the very different thing from a generous
                            sympathy for the legitimate aspiration of the
                            educated youth of India to obtain a greater
                            share than heretofore in the Government and
                            administration of their country. That is just
                            what must be, and is being granted. We know
                            that a definite move has been made with a</p>

                            <p>views of giving competent and able Indians the 
                            same access to the higher posts in the admi-
                            nistration that are given to Britons. We know 
                            that proposals have com to the Secretary of
                            State from the Governor Gerneral in Council,
                            "fraught with the greatest possibilities." But
                            hurry or precipitancy; either on the side of the
                            officials or of the agitators, can only have the 
                            inevitable effect of setting the clock back.
                            These are the words, not of sun-dried
                            bureacrats, but of Mr. Morley, one of the 
                            prominent Liberal statesmen of the age, who 
                            is fully alive to his responsibilities as Secretary
                            of State for India. He sees, just as Lord Cromer
                            sees in Egypt, that the idea of transplanting
                            British institutions wholesale into India is a 
                            fantastic and ludicrous drea, ; even if it could
                            be done, it would not be for the good of India.</p>
                        <p>     Again, Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji tells us that
                        as the Indians are British citizens they are 
                        entitled to all British citizens' rights, inclusing 
                        that of absolute self-government. Of course the
                        flaw in this apparently logical system of
                        government is the theory that all subjects of
                        Imperial rule enjoy equal political rights in
                        every part of the King's dominions.</p>
                        <p>     Our British rights [he continues] are beyon
                        all question. Every British Indian subject
                        has franchise in England as a matter of course, 
                        and the right even to become a member of
                        Parliament : a fortiori, therefore, India ought 
                        to have universal suffrage and parliamentary 
                        institutions. Why should not an Indian enjoy
                        the smae rights and privileges in India which 
                        he would enjoy when in Enland? Why has
                        India not been greeted in the Imperial Con-
                        ference as the Colonial Premiers have been?</p>
                        <p>     The answer to his contention is that India
                        is not one of the colonies, "those great com-
                        munities and nations which have sprung from 
                        this island, and which are the great glory and
                        honour of the people of this island." India is 
                        not one of the daughter nations which have
                        inherited all that England has conquered for 
                        herself in the way of freedom and self-govern-
                        ment. And yet, in the face of these facts, it is
                        urged that the various races which people the
                        continent of India can be admitted by adoption
                        into the vast family, and that Great Britain
                        may become in India the foster mother of
                        federated free and separate States, placed on
                        a fraternal footing with the great self-governing
                        colonies, each with its own local autonamy
                        and independence uner the immediate suprem-
                        acy of England.</p>
                        <p>     That is the ideal of the leaders of the so-
                        called "moderate" party in the Indian nationa-
                        list movement, and formulated by its ablest
                        exponent, Sir Henry Cotton. But the key note
                        of the position is the withdrawal of the British
                        Army, and the vesting of the whole administera-
                        tion, civil and military, executive and judicial,
                        in the various local populations. With the 
                        British Army replaced by provincial national
                        armies, which are to be recruited from the
                        common people, and officered by the native
                        gentry of the provinces in which they are to
                        serve, we are told that there would be both a 
                        safeguard against internal disorder and a 
                        protection against attack from without.</p>
                        <p>But, Sir Henry Cotton argues, there is to
                        be no room for democracy or republican insti-
                        tutions. Though the United States of India 
                        are to be on the fraternal footing with the Colo-
                        nies of England, they should be bound toge-
                        ther by means of some political organisation
                        other than the colonial supremacy of England."
                        "The country still needs the hierarchical 
                        leadership of caste." "What is required, in the 
                        absence of an emasculating foreign army, is an 
                        organisation of small States, each with a prince 
                        at its head, and a small body of patrician
                        aristocracy interposing between him and the
                        lower orders of working-men." The existing 
                        Native States apparently, it is intended, 
                        should remain as they are, becoming federated 
                        with the "small States" mentioned above, 
                        which are to comprise the rest of India. But 
                        what is to prevent these princes from prey-
                        ing on each other, and what is to become 
                        of the numerous solemn guarantees by which
                        the British Government is bound towards the 
                        chiefs? Sir Henry himself admits "practical
                        difficulties," such as "the general character of 
                        the relations between Hindus and Muham-
                        madans, the jealousy which exists and 
                        manifests itself so frequently, even under
                        British rule, in local bursts of popular fana-
                        ticism." </p>
                        <p>     Then there is the case of the European and 
                        Eurasian communities who may choose to 
                        reside in the country. Their welfare is to be 
                        secure by the formation of separate little
                        settlements, with separate political constitu-
                        tions, at suitable localities, at which their 
                        isolation would constrain them to adopt a 
                        more conciliatory demeanour towards the
                        people of the country. I cannot help thinking
                        that, to lay here some of the details of Sir
                        Henry's "ideal," siffices to show that his
                        views are on a par with the reckless policy of
                        Mistapha Kamel Pasha in Egypt.</p>
                        <p>     If space is permitted there are other subjects
                        in Lord Cromer's report, in regard to which
                        interesting comparisons might be drawn</p></div>

                            <p>between Egypt and India. One of the most
                            important is the vernacular Press, to which
                            the enlettered licence now allowed is con-
                            sidered by the most respectable elements of
                            native Egyptian society to be an unmixed
                            evil. Lord Cromer admits that the agita-
                            tors (who use the vernacular Press) are
                            wholly unacrupulous as to the methods whoch
                            they are prepared to adopt for imposing on the
                            credulity of the masses and for inflaming their
                            passions, and that "facts are generally mis-
                            stated, and often wilfully perverted;" yet in
                            the best course to follow was, not check the free-
                            dom of the press, but for the mainenance of
                            public order and to inspire confidence, to
                            increase the British garrison at the cost of an 
                            additional charge of 45,000 a year on the
                            Egyptian taxpayers.</p>
                            <p>     In Lord Cromer's concluding words addressed 
                            to the British officials serving in Egypt, there
                            is much that is applicable to India. British
                            officials may find that certain sections of their own
                            countrymen are disposed to misapprehend their
                            motives, to misinterpret their acts, to uner-
                            rate the very great difficulties of their posi-
                            tions, to hold them responsible for abuses
                            which they are powerless to repress, to mini-
                            mise the good they have done, whilst laying 
                            exaggerated stress on all that still remains
                            undone, and gernally to animadvert on the
                            administration in a spirit, not of fair criticism,
                            but of excessive acerbity.</p>
                            <p>     But there is no ground for discouragement. 
                            And as to any widening of the breach between
                            Indians and Europeans, it is capable of repair,
                            not so much by change of policy or by the 
                            adoption of any striking measures of reform,
                            as by the action of individuals and the proper
